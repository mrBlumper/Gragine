A old test for a (very simple) opengl wrapper for android. Not tested, very dirty code

It was just a small hollidays project to play and mess around with java & android
I know the code isn't so clean and not so optimized, but I had a great time doing it
And because it was just "for fun" their is of everything in this "engine" (collisions, I/O, graphics...)
